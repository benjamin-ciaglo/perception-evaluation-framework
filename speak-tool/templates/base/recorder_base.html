				<p><b>Instructions: </b>You will be submitting audio recordings using the interface provided on one of the following pages. Afterwards, you will listen to the recorded response of a dialogue agent that responds to your recording. You will be asked to rate the recorded response in terms of how trustworthy you perceive it to be.</p>

				<li>Please enable cookies.</li>
				<li>When prompted, grant permission to the site to use your microphone for the duration of the HIT.</li>
				<li>Use the volume meter in the bottom of the window to help ensure that your microphone is working properly, and that you are a proper distance away from it. The meter should move as you speak. <b>If the volume meter does not move, or if the recording button is disabled, please check to make sure that you have given permission to your web browser to access your microphone.</b></li>
				<li>Press the green "Record" button to start recording. After you press it, the button will turn into a red "Stop" button.</li>
				<li>Press the red "Stop" button to stop recording. After you press it, your audio recording will be processed automatically.</li>

				<li>Once you have submitted all the necessary recordings, press the green "Submit" button to submit the HIT.</li>

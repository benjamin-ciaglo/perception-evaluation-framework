It is estimated this task will take you under fifteen minutes, with a total of five pages including this one (assuming instructions are followed and errors do not occur).<br></p>
				<p><b>Instructions: </b>You will be submitting audio recordings using the interface provided on one of the following pages. Afterwards, you will listen to the recorded response of a dialogue agent that responds to your recording. You will be asked to rate the recorded response in terms of how trustworthy you perceive it to be.</p>

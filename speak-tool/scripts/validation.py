## validation 1 - google speech api transcription
# 1. transcribes a given file audio_file, using Google Speech Recognition API
# 2. saves the transcript in a .txt file in the same directory
# 3. returns the transcript as a string
# audio_file: path of the audio file to be transcribed (including extension), as a string
# transc: the resultant transcript, as a string

## validation 1a - transcript word threshold check
# given the transcript as a string, find whether the number of words in transcript is greater than the threshold
# threshold: # of words, as an int
# outputs boolean value; True if passes threshold check, False otherwise

## validation 1b - audio file length threshold check
# given the audiofile path as a string, find whether the length of the recording is greater than the threshold

# outputs boolean value; True if passes threshold check, False otherwise

## validation 2 - comparison w/ transcript
# 1. finds the ground-truth transcript associated with the question.
# 2. calculates the WER (word error rate) for the subject-generated transcript, based on the ground truth.
# 3. saves the WER in a text file in the subject's folder (within the folder for the battery and test), located in user-content.
#	(user-content/proctor/battery/subject/test/question_wer.txt)
# 4. returns the WER as a float
# transcript: the user-generated transcript, as a string
# question: the name of the question the user was given, as a string
